Smart Mirror project

This is a project where I develop a 'smart', interactive mirror. 
I use the [ML5 Library](https://ml5js.org/) for using the AI model [Posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet), and [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for my animations.

The files in this folder contains hand estimation code only, the prototype (using anime.js for animations) is situated in the prototype folder.
